## 🔍 What is UXAudit AI?

**UXAudit AI** is a specialized Micro-SaaS tool designed to eliminate the guesswork from Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO).

Founders and marketers often stare at their landing pages, knowing *something* is wrong but not exactly *what*. Traditional audits require expensive consultants (weeks) or generic SEO tools (that miss visual psychology).

**UXAudit AI bridges this gap.** It uses advanced Vision LLMs to "see" your website like a human expert would—analyzing visual hierarchy, copy clarity, and friction points—delivering actionable, prioritized fixes instantly.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The system follows a streamlined analysis pipeline to ensure high-quality, reproducible results.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Input] -->|URL or Image| B(Validation Layer)
    B -->|Capture/Upload| C{Analysis Engine}
    C -->|Vision AI Processing| D[Heuristic Evaluation]
    D -->|Scoring & Ranking| E[Structured Audit Result]
    E -->|Presentation| F[User Dashboard]
```

1.  **Input**: User provides a URL or uploads a design file.
2.  **Capture**: The system captures a high-res screenshot (headless browser) or processes the uploaded file.
3.  **Analysis**: The image is fed into our Vision AI pipeline with specific context constraints.
4.  **Evaluation**: The AI applies strict UX heuristics (Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics + CRO best practices).
5.  **Result**: A structured audit is generated, saved, and presented with a score and priority list.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

UXAudit AI is built using **Clean Layered Architecture** to ensure detailed separation of concerns, testability, and scalability.

```
src/
├── presentation/    (UI Components, Pages, Styles)
│   └── Responsible for rendering data and capturing user intent.
├── application/     (Use Cases, Ports)
│   └── Orchestrates business logic (e.g., RunAudit, SaveResult).
├── domain/          (Entities, Rules)
│   └── Pure business rules and validation schemas.
└── infrastructure/  (AI, Database, Capture)
    └── External implementations (Supabase, Anthropic, Puppeteer).
```

## 📊 Audit Result Format

The system provides a comprehensive breakdown:

*   **UX Score (0-100)**: A weighted aggregate of usability, clarity, and aesthetics.
*   **Score Breakdown**: Sub-scores for *Visual Hierarchy*, *Conversion*, *Copy*, *Layout*, and *Accessibility*.
*   **Issues List**: Detailed problems containing:
    *   **Evidence**: "The 'Sign Up' button blends into the hero background."
    *   **Recommendation**: "Change the button color to #FF5733 to increase contrast ratio > 4.5:1."
    *   **Impact**: High/Medium/Low.

## ⚖️ Philosophy & Disclaimer

**UXAudit AI is a decision-support tool.**

While our heuristics are based on battle-tested CRO principles, AI can sometimes hallucinate or miss context nuances (like specific brand guidelines). Use these audits as a **high-fidelity second opinion** to speed up your optimization process, not as a replacement for user testing with real humans.
