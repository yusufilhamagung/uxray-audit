# UXRay

**See what's stopping your visitors.**

UXRay audits your website and tells you exactly what to fix—in under two minutes, without signing up.

## Why UXRay Exists

Most websites have friction you can't see.

Visitors leave. You're not sure why. You stare at the page. It looks fine.

But something's off.

Hiring a consultant takes weeks. Running A/B tests takes traffic you don't have. Reading another CRO article doesn't help.

UXRay gives you a second pair of eyes—instantly.

Upload a screenshot. Get clear, prioritized fixes. No guesswork.

## How It Works

1. **Go to the audit page**
   No account needed. Just open `/audit`.

2. **Upload a screenshot or paste a URL**
   Drop your file or enter a link. Choose your page type.

3. **See your results instantly**
   Your top 3 issues appear immediately—what's wrong, why it matters, and what to do.

4. **Unlock the full report** 🔓
   Want deeper analysis? Click "Unlock Full Report" and enter your email.
   The full audit runs on the same screenshot—right there, no page reload.

5. **Run another audit anytime**
   No limits. No waiting. Just keep improving.

- **Instant unlock** — Enter your email, get the full report in seconds
