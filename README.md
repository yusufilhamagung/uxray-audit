## 🧭 What UXRay Does

UXRay looks at your website and tells you what's breaking conversions.

Upload a screenshot or paste a URL. Get prioritized, actionable fixes in under two minutes—without signing up, without waiting, without hiring anyone.

---

## ✨ How It Works

1. **Open the audit page**
   No login. No forms. Just go to `/audit`.

2. **Add your screenshot or URL**
   Drop your file or paste a link. Select your page type.

3. **Get your free preview**
   See your top 3 issues instantly—what's wrong, why it matters, what to fix.

4. **Unlock the full report** 🔓
   Click the CTA, enter your email, and the deeper analysis runs immediately—same screenshot, no reload.

5. **Run another audit**
   Always available. No restrictions. Keep iterating.
